        <p>If you’re an owner wanting to build, you’ve probably got a lot of questions. You know what you want, but construction is a minefield. There is a chance you will emerge unscathed, but, unassisted, you are far more likely to fall victim to a process that can be as devastating as it is counter-intuitive. With timely and easy-to-understand technical advice, expert communication and planning assistance, a savvy owner’s rep will soon become your single biggest asset.</p>
        <h5>Stewart Consulting will keep you informed and in control, so your project is successfully completed</h5>
